UIDAI HACKATHON PS-1: PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS OF AADHAAR UPDATE DEMAND
MODEL DEVELOPMENT - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Developed a machine learning solution to predict Aadhaar update demand and classify
regions for optimal resource allocation across UIDAI service centers.

DATA:
• Total Samples: 100,000
• Features: 132
• Date Range: 2025-03-09 to 2025-12-29
• Training Set: 70,000 samples (70%)
• Validation Set: 15,000 samples (15%)
• Test Set: 15,000 samples (15%)

MODELS EVALUATED:
• Ridge Regression
• Lasso Regression
• Decision Tree Regressor
• Random Forest Regressor
• Gradient Boosting Regressor
• LightGBM Regressor
• LightGBM Regressor (Hyperparameter Tuned) ← SELECTED

BEST MODEL PERFORMANCE:
Model: Ridge Regression
• R² Score: 1.0000 (100.00% variance explained)
• RMSE: 0.00
• MAE: 0.00
• MAPE: inf%

FEATURE IMPORTANCE:
• Top Feature: total_enrolment_state_deviation
• 29 features explain 90% of predictive power
• Key drivers: Temporal patterns, historical demand, regional characteristics

REGIONAL CLASSIFICATION:
• Number of Clusters: 6
• Silhouette Score: 0.5150
• Categories Identified:
  - Medium Demand: 20 regions (40.0%)
  - Low Demand: 18 regions (36.0%)
  - High Demand: 12 regions (24.0%)

ACTIONABLE INSIGHTS:
1. Resource Allocation: Use regional classification to allocate staff and infrastructure
   based on demand categories (High/Medium/Low/Seasonal).

2. Predictive Scheduling: Deploy model to forecast demand 1-3 months ahead for
   proactive capacity planning.

3. Cost Optimization: Focus resources on high-demand regions during peak periods,
   reducing idle capacity in low-demand areas.

4. Performance Monitoring: Track prediction accuracy monthly and retrain model
   quarterly with new data.

2. Set up automated retraining pipeline
3. Develop real-time monitoring system
4. Create API endpoints for demand forecasting
5. Train staff on using predictions for resource planning
